# Hello World Homework Assignment Template

You will be writing a program that uses Scanner to ask for the user's name, and then prints out 
a personalized greeting to that user. Here is an example of how your program should look:

```shell script
What is your name? Nathan
Hello, Nathan!
```

Note that in the above example, the user inputted the name "Nathan". Your program should work
for any name that the user types in. 

Add code to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyClass.java) to do the desired thing.

## Run your code with:
```shell script
make run
```
Or go to [MyMain.java](src/main/java/MyMain.java) and click on `Run` above the `main()` method.

## Run your tests with:
```shell script
make test
```
